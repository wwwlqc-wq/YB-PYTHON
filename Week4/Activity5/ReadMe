📌 Project Name

Clinic Database OOP + Generic ORM-Like Python CRUD Framework

📍 Core Objective

Develop a general-purpose Python database access layer that:

Supports multiple databases: SQLite & MySQL

Uses OOP design for data access abstraction

Implements a clean layered architecture for database operations

Provides entity models, generic repositories, transaction, and logging support

Demonstrates CRUD operations and business queries on clinic data

🛠 Key Technologies and Architecture
⭐ 1. Python Standard Library

sqlite3 for SQLite local database operations

datetime for audit fields (create_time, modify_time)

typing for generic type support: Generic, TypeVar, Type

🧱 2. Database Abstraction Layer

Implemented a unified DBEngine abstract base class:

SQLiteEngine: using sqlite3

MySQLEngine: using third-party module pymysql

Standardized interface for: execute, fetch, executescript, commit, rollback, close

All SQL queries are parameterized to prevent SQL injection

Pluggable DB engines improve cross-database compatibility and maintainability

🧠 3. Generic Repository Design (Generic + OOP)

Implemented Repository[T] using Python generics:

Supports any BaseEntity subclass

Automatically adapts SQL placeholders (? for SQLite, %s for MySQL)

Encapsulates common CRUD operations:

insert, select, select_by_id

update_by_id, soft_delete, hard_delete

Supports pagination and LIKE queries

Recognizes primary key fields, auto-handles audit fields, and soft delete flags

This design follows the Repository and MyBatis-style layered pattern.

🧾 4. ORM-Like Entity Mapping

Entity classes inherit a base class:

Includes audit fields: create_time, modify_time, is_deleted

Can declare primary key and field lists

Can easily convert objects to SQL field dictionaries

Repository layer maps objects to SQL parameters automatically

🔍 5. SQL Logging with AOP

Implemented debug_sql decorator:

Automatically prints generated SQL for every execution

Formats parameters in color for clarity

Displays execution time for monitoring

Similar to Java/MyBatis SQL interceptors

🧪 6. Core Business Implementation

Clinic scenario examples:

List all patients over 65 years old

Count doctors specialized in ophthalmology

All queries are implemented via the generic Repository and SQL combination.

🧩 Design Highlights

✔ Generic + base classes improve code reuse
✔ Layered architecture inspired by enterprise frameworks
✔ Dynamic SQL placeholders for multi-database support
✔ Automatic audit field handling
✔ Pagination and fuzzy search support
✔ SQL debug logging for observability
